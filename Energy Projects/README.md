# Energy Projects

There are a few projects on CMU's Building Energy Data. The description of these projects is listed below:

1. Appliance state estimation using Hidden Markov Models

2. Basic Visualization and transformations on Pandas

3. Campus Energy Forecasting using Deep Learning. This includes extraction of weather data, transforming of data for neural network input, and feeding the data through the neural network model (TensorFlow) (3% Mean Average Percentage Error) (Hyperparameter tuning and layer selection tuning under progress)

4. CMU campus electricity demand forecasting using piecewise linear regression of weather and categorical time features, compared to another piecewise regression of modified time features

5. Energy disaggregation using generative modeling (Bayesian inference under progress)

6. Advanced visualization and processing of CMU campus data. Estimating feature similarity score using K-Means unsupervised learning.

7. An analysis of US Power Plants using R (Notebooks). Involves data analysis, transformation and policy recommendations.

8. A detailed energy and cost analysis of municipal buildings in Western PA. It involves detailed visualizations using Tableau and R, regressional models, outlier analysis, energy usage and cost benchmarking using K-Means.
