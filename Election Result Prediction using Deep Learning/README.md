# TensorFlow Tutorial

Created a tutorial to explain how Tensorflow works in a data science pipeline by estimating US Primary Election Results using supervised learning of demographic data as features. It proved the underlying correlation between Primary candidates and the demographics that they were targeting.

Pipeline

1) Data Cleaning

2) Data Transformation and Visualization

3) Data Mining using a 4-layer deep neural network

4) Accuracy of over 80% achieved in predicting Democrat and Republican Party elections.
